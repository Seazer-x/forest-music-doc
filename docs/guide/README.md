What is Quasar?
Quasar (pronounced /ˈkweɪ.zɑɹ/) is an MIT licensed open-source Vue.js based framework, which allows you as a web developer to quickly create responsive++ websites/apps in many flavours:

SPAs (Single Page App)
SSR (Server-side Rendered App) (+ optional PWA client takeover)
PWAs (Progressive Web App)
BEX (Browser Extension)
Mobile Apps (Android, iOS, …) through Cordova or Capacitor
Multi-platform Desktop Apps (using Electron)
Quasar’s motto is: write code once and simultaneously deploy it as a website, a Mobile App and/or an Electron App. Yes, one codebase for all of them, helping you develop an app in record time by using a state-of-the-art CLI and backed by best-practice, blazing fast Quasar web components.

When using Quasar, you won’t need additional heavy libraries like Hammer.js, Moment.js or Bootstrap. It’s got those needs covered internally, and all with a small footprint!

What else you got?
Because of the simplicity and power offered to you out of the box, Quasar, with its CLI, is packed full of features, all built to make your developer life easier.

Food for thought


Quasar is looking into the future and sets its own high and modern standards. And yes, in order to make progress in web development, we need to break the current establishment. Otherwise, we’d all continue to write websites in cgi-bin / perl today too, because many years ago that’s what developers were accustomed to. However, what most developers are accustomed to at one point in time doesn’t actually mean it’s the best solution or the “definite” solution, and Quasar will never bend into choosing what we believe is not the optimal path to high-quality work, not even over money.

What we want to achieve with Quasar is to raise the bar for web development as a whole. Make it go forward, evolve. Change minds. Point out when there’s a better alternative.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of Quasar’s great aspects and features.
